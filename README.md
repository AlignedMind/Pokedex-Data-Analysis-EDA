# *Nintendo/GameFreak Pokemon Pokedex EDA*

## Business Case 

The Pokemon Pokedex is a fictional digital database that holds data on species called "Pokemon".
This database is consistantly evolving as new species are created by the talented people over at GameFreak and Nintendo.

With each game release there has been notable adjustments to the core gameplay. Primarily the inclusion of new features and new pokemon. In the most recent years there has been a notable decline in new species, and a trend of revisting old pokemon and just creating variations from them that vary by region.

By performing exploratory data analysis, I discover which bias the developers have had in the development of these pokemon. Utilizing features that correspond to the core statistics that showcases a pokemons combat potential, I began to see which types were favorited and which ones that were not. In these discoveries I saw the affinities that lie within particular pokemon types. This could lead to potential type combinations that do not exist currently and can allow for further innovation in the species development process.
