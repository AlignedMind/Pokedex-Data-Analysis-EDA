# *Nintendo/GameFreak Pokemon Pokedex EDA*

## Business Case 

The Pokemon Pokedex is a fictional digital database that holds data on species called "Pokemon".This database is consistently evolving as new species are created by the talented people over at Game Freak and Nintendo.

With each game release there has been notable adjustments to the core gameplay. Primarily the inclusion of new features and new Pokémon. In the most recent years there has been a notable decline in new species, and a trend of revisiting old Pokémon and creating variations from them that vary by region.

By performing exploratory data analysis, I discover which bias the developers have had in the development of these Pokémon. Utilizing features that correspond to the core statistics that showcases a Pokémon’s combat potential, I began to see which types were favorited and which ones that were not. In these discoveries I saw the affinities that lie within particular Pokémon types. This could lead to potential type combinations that do not exist currently and can allow for further innovation in the species development process.
