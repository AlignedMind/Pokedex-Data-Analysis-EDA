## Data Science EDA. project on The Complete Pokemon Pokedex

Welcome! to my Exploratory Data Analysis project on Pokémon. Pokémon for me growing up was a huge part of my childhood and in many ways, I always sought to be better at the game. One of the many ways I strived to be a better Pokémon trainer included learning and exploring the games internal data values. These values were originally hidden from the player but could be hinted at which category they fell into by a particular in game character. Furthermore, numerically out of the six statistical categories a Pokémon possessed they are allowed 0 - 31 of these values per stat they are known as IV's (Individual Values) IV's are similar to innate potential and represent the potential for that respective attribute.

Moreover, there was another semi-hidden value these are known as EV’s (Effort Values) and unlike the later these values are not distributed via birth but allotted from training. Developing that particular attribute of the Pokémon increases these values, they range from 0 - 252 per stat with a total investment per Pokémon of 510.

I seek with this project to provide insights on the Pokémon with high value attributes and show why you should invest into them when considering building a team. Also to run a classification algorithms such as logistic regression and or random forest to predict which pokemon is which an homage to the classic commericial Transition from the pokemon t.v show.
